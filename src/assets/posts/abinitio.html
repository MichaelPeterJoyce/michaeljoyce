    <p>Abinitio V6 is the current project I am working on with Celtech Software Group.
        Abintitio V6 is the largest frontend project I have worked on. The project was built using Angular.js 1.4
        and built with Grunt.js.
        When I joined Celtech the application was well under way with development using Angular.js 1.4 but was not
        following the style guide by John Papa for Angular.js which is recomennded by the industry. The project was
        built with grunt and had a local folder of vendor javascript files that where out of date.
    </p>
    <p>
        We decided it would be best to spend some time getting the application ready to upgrade to a newer version of
        Angular 2+ with Webpack. We began by upgrading to Angular.js 1.6 and converting all the controller - view
        combos
        to Angular.js 1.6 components. We also took this oppurtunity to move to ES6 javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        Refactoring such a massive code base took a long time and we made progress during sprints by allowing some time
        for tech debt at the end.
        In the meantime we started the move from Grunt to Webpack 4 to allow us easier use of ES6 imports for
        our project.
        I spent a sprint creating the webpack development and production configuration files. We implemented the
        configuration for Webpack 4 and moved all our local Javscript vendor files to dependecies from NPM
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step on our road to upgrading was to move to Typescript. Typescript is becoming very popular in the
        industry and the IDE experience for development and the strong typing and interfaces which we could build to
        match the Java backend where major motivators in taking the time to refactor everything to typescript.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we had moved to Webpack and had refactored most of the code to follow the style guide and use typescript I
        introduced Angular
        7 to the application in a hybrid state. All new components are created using Angular 7 and we use ngDowngrade
        to downgrade them for use in the large Angular.js codebase. This allows us to go back and rewrite older
        Angular.js components to Angular 7 while still keeping a shippable product.

    <h4>The Application</h4>
    <p>
        The Application is an admin application for a user to login and view report data for thier products. The
        application has
        CRUD screens for creating new products, promotions, customers and allows for the management of GDPR requests.
    </p>
    <p>The application connects to a RESTFul API backend built using SpringBoot. The SpringBoot application works with
        an older IBM DB2 Database which is used by the older V5 version of the product for compatibilty</p>
