        Skillsboost was the first small application I worked on. It was a frontend application that sold Online
        eLearning courses via PayPal.
        The frontend was built in Backbone.js connecting to a RESTFul api backend built in PHP Zend 2 Framework.

    <p>
        The application allowed users to browse a store for courses, purchase a course via PayPal and then login to an
        Account Page where they could track their progress and continue their purchased courses.
