        I worked as the Frontend web developer for Tell Us First using the following software stack.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Backbone.js</li>
        <li>Underscore.js</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        Tell Us First hereby called TUF for short allows a user to create a public facing customer feedback portal. A
        user
        can sign up and generate a URL that they can give to their customers which allows them to collect feedback for a
        particular location or the entire organisation. When a customer visits this URL via QR or NFC they are presented
        with 4 smiley faces. The admin can set up the application to stop after the smiley click or continue to ask the
        customer more in depth questions.
