    <p>TellUsFirst was a project I worked on when working with Optimum Results.
        Optimum Results is a small training company in Dundalk, Co.Louth that specializes in training for SME's in Ireland
        and
        Internationally
        Tell Us First was the first big commercial project that I worked on as a frontend web developer.
        I worked as the Frontend web developer for Tell Us First using the following software stack.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Backbone.js</li>
        <li>Underscore.js</li>
        <li>ChartNew.js</li>
        <li>Bootstrap 3 CSS</li>
        <li>jQuery</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Tell Us First hereby called TUF for short allows a user to create a public facing customer feedback portal. A
        user
        can sign up and generate a URL that they can give to their customers which allows them to collect feedback for a
        particular location or the entire organisation.</p>
    <p>
        When a customer visits this URL via QR or NFC they are presented
        with 4 smiley faces. The admin can set up the application to stop after the smiley click or continue to ask the
        customer more in depth questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Dashboard
        The dashboard for TUF was designed for an Admin to login and view the data that has been collected for their
        account.
        This dashboard supports the basic CRUD operations of the site like creating and maintaining a quiz. It also has
        a rich reporting aspect to allow admins to drill through and view graphs representing all their information.
